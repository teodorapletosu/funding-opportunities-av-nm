                    The dedicated programme for audiovisual and news media sectors
                  </h3>
                <p>
                  The main goal of the Creative Europe programme is to promote,
                  strengthen and protect European cultural and linguistic
                  diversity, cultural heritage and creativity, as well as the
                  competitiveness of Europe's cultural and creative sectors.
                  Culture plays a pivotal role in addressing key societal and
                  economic challenges, especially in promoting active
                  citizenship, common values, wellbeing, innovation, economic
                  growth and job creation.
                  <br />
                  The Creative Europe programme includes a MEDIA strand to
                  support the European audiovisual industry, a CULTURE strand to
                  promote other European cultural and creative sectors, and a
                  CROSS-SECTORAL strand to support actions spanning across the
                  audiovisual and other cultural and creative sectors.

                <p>
                  The Erasmus+ programme provides opportunities for education,
                  training, young people and sport in Europe, enabling millions
                  of Europeans to study, train or learn abroad while broadening
                  their experience and awareness of Europe, and increasing the
                  future chances on the job market. A double funding for the
                  2012-2027 period will boost the programme's effectiveness in
                  building a European Education Area by 2025, empowering young
                  people and promoting a European identity through youth,
                  education and culture. The new programme will enable:

                    Strengthening the European Union's internal market
                  </h3>
                <p>
                  The Single Market Programme is the new EU programme which aims
                  to empower and protect consumers, and enable Europe's many
                  SMEs to take full advantage of the Single Market. The new
                  programme will strengthen the governance of the EU's internal
                  market. It will support businesses' and in particular SMEs' 
                  competitiveness and will promote human, animal and plant
                  health and animal welfare, as well as establish the framework
                  for financing European statistics. The new Single Market
                  Programme will support six main policy areas:
                </p>

                    building on the success of the current programme for the
                    Competitiveness of Enterprises and Small and Medium-sized
                    Enterprises (COSME), the new programme will strengthen the
                    support given to small business to scale up and expand
                    across borders;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Consumer protection:</span>
                    the programme will guarantee the enforcement of consumer
                    rights, ensure a high level of consumer protection and
                    product safety and assist consumers when they encounter
                    problems, for example when shopping online;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Food safety:</span>
                    funding will support the safe production of food, the
                    prevention and eradication of animal diseases and plant
                    pests, and the improvement of animal welfare in the EU;

                  <li>
                    <span style="font-weight:bold;">Effective standards:</span>
                    the programme will strengthen cooperation between EU
                    countries and the Commission to ensure that EU rules are
                    properly implemented and enforced;

                    the programme will help the Commission to further enhance
                    its IT tools and expertise that it uses to effectively
                    enforce competition rules in the digital economy (i.e. to
                    respond to market developments such as the use of big data
                    and algorithms);

                <p>
                  The Next Generation EU package is the major recovery plan proposed by the European Commission to immediately address the socio-economic damage created by the COVID-19 pandemic and to start building a more resilient, sustainable and healthier society capable of better facing future global health and economic threats. The proposal aims to boost the long-term budget of the European Union for 2021-2027 (earmarked at &euro;1100 billion - 2018 prices). In July the European Commission borrowed &euro;750 billion (at 2018 prices) on the financial markets to fund the Next Generation EU package over the next 3 to 6 years. Next Generation EU will be channelled through existing EU programmes and a number of new instruments:

                  <h3>Opportunities at regional level</h3>
                  <p>
                    A large part of the Next Generation EU budget will be managed at national levels through the Recovery and Resilience Facility and through the REACT-EU initiative. The latter delivers on a strengthened Cohesion Policy to support workers and SMEs, health systems and society's green and digital transition. As a cross-sectorial initiative, it presents important opportunities for the creative industries.  
                    <br />
                    Over the past years, the creative industries have increasingly benefited from regional investment under the Cohesion Policy via the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) which are its main financial instrument. Regions need to create development strategies by identifying strategic areas for intervention - the so-called Research and Innovation Smart Specialisation Strategies (RIS3). These strategies can channel support for the audiovisual and news media sectors to enable them to contribute to a number of key objectives, such as competitiveness of SMEs, improving access to culture, digitisation of services, sustainable tourism infrastructure and ICT etc. 
                    <br />
                  Below are 3 examples of strategies developed around audiovisual and news media sectors in different regions across Europe:

                          North Rhine-Westphalia is home to vibrant film and gaming industries and a strong publishing and media sector. The diverse cultural scene and the high concentration of TV and radio stations, network operators, telecommunication giants and content providers accelerate the process of media convergence and a productive crossover between the arts, culture and the media, thus boosting creativity, innovation and eventually economic growth. In order to consolidate its leading position in the media sector in Europe, the region supports the media and creative industry through numerous funding programmes, notably for start-ups and young entrepreneurs, such as the <a href="https://www.filmstiftung.de/en/" target="_blank">Film- und Medienstiftung NRW</a>. With an annual budget of nearly &euro; 35 million, the Fund supports films for cinema and television during the stages of production and distribution, as well as the development of innovative audiovisual content.

A number of regional initiatives support the development of this strategic sector. The Creative Wallonia program supports cross-fertilisation between creative industries (including film, gaming, transmedia) with other economic sectors, such as health and information and communication technology (ICT), to boost territorial development. The <a href="http://www.start-invest.be/bienvenue?lang=fr" target="_blank">St'Art Investment</a> fund supports SMEs active in the creative industries, including non-for-profit organisations, with a budget of nearly &euro; 37 million. The fund provides financing in the form of loans and investments and contributes to the creation of companies and the development of existing structures in order, for example, to undertake new projects, create new products and win new markets.

                          The Veneto Region hosts numerous cultural and creative industries (particularly in the audiovisual and heritage sectors). The region highly invests in the strong potential of its creative industries as driver of economic and social development. In particular, the region promotes cross-sectorial collaboration between creative industries and ICT, new technologies and eco materials for new products and services. The region launched two specific calls for projects with the European Regional Development Fund (2 for start-ups and 2 for innovation). This is the first formal recognition of "culture as business" for the Veneto government. The calls will co-fund the purchase of technical equipment or software to support the digital transformation of creative businesses. The total budget invested in the creative industries is &euro;  11 million (an additional 5&euro;  million feeds the support for audiovisual and cinema productions).
